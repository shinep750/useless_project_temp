### Project Description
An AI-powered web app that analyzes audio recordings of chopping sounds. It detects each individual chop, analyzes the rhythm, intensity, and sound characteristics, and then determines the emotional state or "mood" of the chef.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world has long been plagued by the emotional ambiguity of kitchen sounds. When you hear someone chopping vegetables, are those the swift, happy chops of a culinary artist in their element, or the angry, aggressive thuds of someone who just read their emails? We are solving the critical problem of not knowing whether to approach the chef or run for the hills.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Chef Mood Analyzer! This revolutionary tool listens to your knife work using a microphone or an uploaded audio file. It employs sophisticated audio analysis to measure the consistency, speed, and force of your chopping, providing a definitive verdict on your mood‚Äîfrom "üòå Zen Master" to "üò° Aggressive"‚Äîall displayed in a beautiful, data-rich interface.
